# Image_Classification
This project is a deep learning-based image classifier trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras. 
The model classifies images into one of 10 categories:

🚀 Categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

📌 Features
✅ Trained on CIFAR-10 – A benchmark dataset for image classification
✅ Uses CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Batch Normalization, and Dense layers
✅ Implemented in TensorFlow & Keras
✅ Predicts custom images uploaded by users

📌 Model Architecture
Conv2D + ReLU Activation (Feature Extraction)

Batch Normalization (Stable Training)

MaxPooling (Dimensionality Reduction)

Flatten + Dense Layers (Classification)

Softmax Output Layer (10 Classes)
